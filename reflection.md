- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    It was rather clear compared to the idea of associations. It made sense that the class inheriting the parent gets access to the parent's classes. To me, it made sense because I was putting it in the context of me sharing my father's apple id and having to inherit all of his files when I did. Knowing this definitely makes the programming easier and less work if you know in advance what methods the parent has. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    It worked pretty smoothly because the instructions were very precise and clear. I was able to start House and when I got it, I applied it to the other two. Figuring out how to set booleans and return booleans was a little confusing. I also had a hard time with Hashtables and its specific calls. I really suggest going one by one and understanding what is going on in one class so you don't get it mixed up (which is what happened with me in the last homework.)
